### How to consume LipaNaMpesaOnline(STK PUSH) endpoint with this package.

#### Payment flow involved with this endpoint.
1. Your system initiates a payment request to you on behalf of client and sends it to safaricom.
2. Safaricom sends the request to the client requesting them to authorize the transaction by entering their M-PESA PIN.
3. If client enters their correct M-PESA PIN, safaricom respond to your system with details regarding the transaction. This is made possible by sending an internet accessible URL via a CallBackUrl.

#### Usage
